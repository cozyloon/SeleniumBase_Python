# SeleniumBase Python

Initialize a Python Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. Inside the project directory we created in the previous step, create a virtual environment using the following command:

```python -m venv venv```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows: ```venv\\Scripts\\activate```
- On macOS and Linux: source ```venv/bin/activate```

Install SeleniumBase

```pip install seleniumbase```

Check the SeleniumBase installation is successfully completed

Type ```seleniumbase``` or ```sbase``` in terminal
